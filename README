Welcome to "pd", the alternative to "ls".

  Description:   This program will read the current directory or the 
                 directories listed on the command line and display the
                 contents showing the "files" first then the "directories".
                 This program can be used instead of "ls".

                 Check the "Makefile" and verify that the pathnames.

                 A useful alias for csh is "l", it clear the screen first:
                     # alias l "clear ; pd \!* | more"

                 For sh user, create a script as follows:
                     #! /bin/sh
